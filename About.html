      I am a self-proclaimed artist. To me this isn't just a hobby but my passion, I could spend hours in the studio creating art. I was awarded the privliage to have a few of my pieces displayed at the Baton Rouge Art Gallary in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. My dream is to create the world's first African-American Art Park. Depicting black people as they truly are, and inspiring young african-americans that they can be more than a stereotype or statistic.

        I love traveling and visiting different countries. Yes, sitting on the beach and sipping margaritas is fun, however, if I only did that I would be cheating myself out of an oppertunity to experience life outside of my everday routine.
      </p>
      <p>When I travel its more about experiencing different cultures, tasting the food and understanding the people. I have visited five countries so far, each more unique than the next. I aspire to obtain dual-citizanship and live in a country where its beautiful year round.

            Working out is a pretty big part of my life, it is an activity that makes me feel good about myself and overall helps boost my mood. Eating healthy goes hand and hand with working out. I have developed some great eating habits, to the point where I dont crave the "bad stuff" anymore. Although, I'm not perfect and I do induldge in a cheat meal every once in a while. I can truly say I'm not where I was when I first started. I'm glad I never gave up on myself.
