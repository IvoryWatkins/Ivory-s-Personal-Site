   <h4>The goal is to be extrodinary, however, that doesn't start with the occupation you have, nor the amount of money in you'r bank account. Those things do not define a person their actions and what they put out onto the world is what matters. You become extraordinary when you work on things people can't take away from you. Such as you'r character, mindset, personality, you'r entire being.
